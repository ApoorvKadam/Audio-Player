# Audio-Player
The Audio Player App is a project developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This project is interesting for listening to our self-made songs collection app. The user can play different kinds of music and enjoy the sound of their music. The user can adjust the background color of the app and click the forward and backward play button to change the songs.
